<p>
The prices set here are negotiable (I work with budgets) and are subject to change. In order to commission me you may send me a message somewhere such as Instagram, Twitter, etc., or my email (all of this information is located on the <a href="/">homepage</a>, as are examples of my work). Payment methods will be discussed alongside the commission. Although I deal mainly in USD I am open to barters, payments in cryptocurrency, etc; just ask. If you want to work with me for anything not listed here (such as web design) or want to commission me for a larger project you can still message me and we can discuss. I withold the right to decline any request to commission for any reason or to request payments higher than the prices listed here.
