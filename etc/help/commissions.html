<h2>Witch for hire.</h2>

<p>
The prices set here are negotiable (I work with budgets) and are subject to change. In order to commission me you may send me a message somewhere such as Instagram, Twitter, etc. or my email (all of this information is located on the <a href="/">homepage</a>). Payment methods will be discussed alongside the commission. Although I deal mainly in USD I am open to barters, payments in cryptocurrency, etc. Just ask. If you want to work with me for anything not listed here (such as web design) or want to commission me for a larger project you can still message me and we can discuss. I withold the right to decline any request to commission for any reason or to request payments higher than the prices listed here.
